# Background
This repository contains analysis code for the publication found [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.26.582055), which explored the response of astrocytes, neurons and astro-neuronal co-cultures to alpha-synuclein oligomers. <br><br> 

The analysis includes work shared between two repositories: <br>
- This current repository contains single cell and bulk RNA-sequencing analysis of the cell culture models utilised in the study. <br>
- The repository at [https://github.com/aaronwagen/Astrocytes_editing](https://github.com/aaronwagen/Astrocytes_editing) contains the analysis of RNA editing in the cell culture models, as well as in a [published dataset](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00401-021-02343-x) of post-mortem brain samples.
